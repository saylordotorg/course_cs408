Course Syllabus for "CS408: Advanced Artificial Intelligence"
-------------------------------------------------------------

This course will present advanced topics in Artificial Intelligence
(AI).  We will begin by defining the term “software agent” and
discussing how software agents differ from programs in general.  We will
then take a look at those problems in the field of AI that tend to
receive the most attention.  Different researchers approach these
problems differently.  In this course, we will focus on how to build and
search graph data structures needed to create software agents, an
approach that you will find useful for solving many problems in AI.  We
will also learn to “break down” larger problems into a number of more
specific, manageable sub-problems. In the latter portion of this course,
we will review the study of logic and conceptualize the differences
between propositional logic, first-order logic, fuzzy logic, and default
logic.  After learning about statistical tools commonly used in AI and
about the basic symbol system used to represent knowledge, we will focus
on artificial neural network and machine learning, which are essential
components of computational and statistical methods, and theoretical
computer science.  The course will then conclude with a study of the
Turing machine and a discussion of the questionable claims that human
thinking is a symbol manipulation.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:  
  

-   Define the term “intelligent agent,” list major problems in AI, and
    identify the major approaches to AI.
-   Translate problems into graphs and encode the procedures that search
    the solutions with the graph data structures.
-   Explain the differences between various types of logic and basic
    statistical tools used in AI.
-   List the different types of learning algorithms and explain why they
    are different.
-   List the most common methods of statistical learning and
    classification and explain the basic differences between them.
-   Describe the components of Turing machine.
-   Name the most important propositions in the philosophy of AI.
-   List the major issues pertaining to the creation of machine
    consciousness.
-   Design a reasonable software agent with java code.
