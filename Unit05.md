**Unit 5: Philosophical Foundations of AI** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, we will study the Turing machine as a definition of the
intuitive notion of computability in the discrete domain.  In the theory
of computation, many major complexity classes can be characterized by an
appropriately restricted Turing machine.  We will also discuss the claim
that human thinking is a kind of symbol manipulation.  Note that a
symbol system is necessary for intelligence and that machines can be
intelligent.  Finally, we will discuss the ongoing neuroscientific
attempt to understand how the human brain works and examine the possible
role of consciousness in the machines.  Is it possible, in theory and
then in practice, to create a machine that has all the capabilities of a
human being?*
